# Heart Disease Rate Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts heart disease rates using Logistic Regression. To enhance the dataset and reduce bias, Python generators are employed to create synthetic data. The model is trained on the Kaggle Heart Disease Prediction dataset and aims to improve prediction accuracy by balancing the data distribution.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Uses Logistic Regression to classify the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Python generators are implemented to create additional data points, reducing dataset bias.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes features, and performs feature selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Since the entire project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps to run it:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the notebook file (`heart-dis-pred-sruj.ipynb`) and run all the cells.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **Kaggle Heart Disease Prediction Dataset**, which contains various health parameters to predict heart disease probability.
